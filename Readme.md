### Project Overview:
In this project, you'll build a **Kanban Task Management Web App**. The goal is to create a fully functional, interactive Kanban board that allows users to manage their tasks across different projects and categories. You'll focus on implementing essential task management features, such as creating, and deleting tasks, and providing a responsive UI that works well across devices.
